# CalcMatch

This project is a Calculus Matching Game created by 
Jurgen Famula, Peyton Norder, Kordell Flores, George Young, and Elisabeth 
Bristol at the University of Denver for the Spring 2019 Software Engineering
course. 

Please refer to the detailed README in the UserResources folder in the next 
directory for detailed instructions for expansion and use. All development 
documents can also be found in that folder including SCRUM logs, diagrams, and
a copy of the final presentation.

Note that the rest of this file system is specific to the way Unity builds a 
project. To view the specifics of our project, navigate to 
Assets/ProjectFiles/Scenes which stores the bulk of the code specific to
